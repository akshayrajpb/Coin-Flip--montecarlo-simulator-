# Coin-Flip--montecarlo-simulator-
Perform a Monte Carlo simulation in Python. The Monte Carlo method is an approach to understanding the results of a random process or group of random processes. The intuition behind a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is simple, though the implementation can be tricky. Still, the MC approach is well worth understanding, since it's often the simplest way to explore complicated outcomes driven by a series of random events.

Goals:

  - Perform a Monte Carlo simulation in Python.

  - Learn how to implement Artificial Neural Networks in Python.
